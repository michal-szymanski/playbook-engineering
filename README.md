# Hello!

Welcome to my repository. This project has been created using React.js via Next.js (only one page, client-side). It is:

-   Fully type safe
-   Fully responsive
-   Fully accessible (I'm using shadcn-ui for this)
-   Bulletproof (30 tests)

Hopefully you will find this good enough.

It has been deployed to Vercel, you can access it here: [https://playbook-engineering.vercel.app](https://playbook-engineering.vercel.app)

Or if you wish to run it locally

```bash
pnpm install
```

And then

```bash

```

## Additional info

If you would like to check out my other work, please visit my [E-commerce](https://github.com/michal-szymanski/e-commerce) repository. It is a full-stack application built with Next.js. It has:

-   Integration with payment system (test environment, use card with number 424242 etc)
-   Authentication
-   Product search mechanism
-   Order creation mechanism

And much more. Just keep in mind this is in active development so a lot of stuff will be improved over time :)
